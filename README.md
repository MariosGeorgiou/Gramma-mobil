# Gramma-mobil
‘Gramma-mobil’ is a synthetic word. It comes from the Greek word ‘gramma’ that means ‘letter’ and the word ‘mobil’ that means movement. The scribbler 2 robot has the functionality to move around, using its 2 motor wheels and 1 balance wheel, while the same time leave traces behind it (if there is a marker attached on the middle). I wanted to use scribbler’s main functionality by teaching the robot to move in certain paths, so that it draws letters from the alphabet and create sentenses. The idea of leaving behind tracks that other humans can understand and read was interesting for me.
